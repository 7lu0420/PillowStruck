Ground control to Major Tom
Ground control to Major Tom
Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on.
Ground control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown engines on
Detach from station and may God′s love be with you

This is ground control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
But it′s time to guide the capsule if you dare

This is Major Tom to ground control
I've left forevermore
And I'm floating in most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
The planet Earth is blue and there′s nothing left to do

Though I′ve flown one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And before too long I know it′s time to go
Our commander comes down back to earth, and knows

Ground control to Major Tom
The time is near, there's not too long
Can you hear me Major Tom?
Can you hear me Major Tom?
Can you hear me Major Tom?
Can you

Here am I floating in my tin can
A last glimpse of the world
The planet Earth is blue and there′s nothing left to do
