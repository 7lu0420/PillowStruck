Ava-Max_Ghost
You′re in my blood and you're in my veins
And you′re appearing in every face
So out of earth, I'm in outer spaceCaught up in my dreams but I'm wide awake

Footsteps are following me all night long
Spirits are calling on me, something′s wrong
Can′t shake off my emotions, way too strong
Heart is underground and I feel you all around

Everywhere I go
I'm haunted by your ghost
You stay on my mind, can′t help but keep you close

Ooh, baby, everywhere I go
I'm haunted by your ghost
You′re the one I love and I fear the most

Keep having visions I can't control
I close my еyes just to feel your soul
It′s in the air and I think you know
That if I nevеr stop I might overdose

Footsteps are following me all night long
Spirits are calling on me, something's wrong
Can't shake off my emotions, way too strong
Heart is underground and I feel you all around

Everywhere I go
I′m haunted by your ghost
You stay on my mind, can′t help but keep you close

Ooh, baby, everywhere I go
I'm haunted by your ghost
You′re the one I love and I fear the most

(I'm haunted by your ghost)
(It′s what I fear the most)
(I'm haunted by your ghost)
(It′s what I fear the most)

Everywhere I go
I'm haunted by your ghost
You stay on my mind, can't help but keep you close

Ooh, baby, everywhere I go
I′m haunted by your ghost
You′re the one I love and I fear the most

Everywhere I go
I'm haunted by your ghost
You stay on my mind, can′t help but keep you close

Ooh, baby, everywhere I go
I'm haunted by your ghost
You′re the one I love and I fear the most

(I'm haunted by your ghost)
(It′s what I fear the most) (hey, hey)
(I'm haunted by your ghost)
(It's what I fear the most)
