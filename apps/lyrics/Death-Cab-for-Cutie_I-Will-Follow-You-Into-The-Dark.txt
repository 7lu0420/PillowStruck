Death-Cab-for-Cutie_I-Will-Follow-You-Into-The-Dark
Love of mine
Someday you will die
But I′ll be close behindI'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light
Or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no′s" on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school
As vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised
By a lady in black
And I held my tongue
As she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love"
So I never went back

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no′s" on their vacancy signs
If there′s no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me
Have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
But it′s nothing to cry about
'Cause we′ll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

And if heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
If there′s no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Then I'll follow you into the dark
