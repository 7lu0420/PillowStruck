Mega-19_New-Light
You hear something long enough you start to believe it
Get broken-hearted enough it′s so hard to heal it
You told me I was wrong and I started to feel it, oohFor a moment I'd forgotten who I am
Now I′m rolling back the dark again

Starting to see me in a new light
Watch all the shadows fall behind me 'til I'm out of sight
I keep on walking ′till I′m someone you won't recognize
Starting to see me in a new light

No pain, no gain, you hurt and think that it′s worth it
Stuck in that bubble and you don't want to burst it
Your head thinks you found love, but your heart′s still searching, ooh
And I feel like I've forgotten who I am
The me before you and I began

Starting to see me in a new light
Watch all the shadows fall behind me ′til I'm out of sight
I keep on walking 'til I′m someone you won′t recognize
Starting to see me in a new light

I keep on walking 'til I′m someone you won't recognize
Starting to see me in a new light

Starting to see me in a new light
