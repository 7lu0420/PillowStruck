Sad-Frosty_Swerve
Huh? What? Thottie!
Bitch! Yuh, ayy, what?
Astro got it runnin′
Say yo' grace, ho, ′cause, bitch, it's over
I had 80K, I blew that copped a range rover (Skrrt)
I be swerving, switchin' lanes,
So hard I damn near broke my shoulder (A′ight)
If she wanna fuck with us I tell
Her, lil thot, bend it over, huh (Huh)
Bu-Bu-Bust down on my dick, do a split, ho (Thottie)
She throw it back, I might fuck around pay yo rent ho
All these pussies cappin′ 'bout shit they
Don′t really get, though (Huh? What? What?)
Lil' Frosty so pretty, got bitches who workin′ for Bang Bros
Say yo' grace, ho, ′cause, bitch, it's over
I had 80K, I blew that copped a range rover (Skrrt)
I be swerving, switchin' lanes,
So hard I damn near broke my shoulder (A′ight)
If she wanna fuck with us I tell her, lil thot, bend it over, huh
Hol′ up, (What?) all these broke boys, they can't stand me
I just hit it raw, then I made her swallow Plan B (Bitch)
Pull out the choppa and I aim it at your granny (Thottie)
That bitch don′t speak my language,
She said she do not understand me (Yuh, yuh)
Just DM'd your bitch, she said I′m a snack, (What?)
Send boys to your addy, drop a pin on the map (Huh?)
Did laps with your bitch just like I'm on a track,
I sold out my show then brought fans through the back
Snuck fans through the back, we make some hoes dance
Hundred thousand, got it all in advance
Air Force Ones I don′t fuck with no Vans
I feel like Tekashi, you won't get a chance (Stupid)
Say yo' grace, ho, ′cause, bitch, it′s over
I had 80K, I blew that copped a range rover
I be swerving, switchin' lanes, so hard I damn near broke my shoulder
If she wanna fuck with us I tell
Her, lil thot, bend it over, huh (Huh)
