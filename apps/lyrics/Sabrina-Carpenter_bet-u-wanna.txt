Told me, told me I′m your only
It's all unfolding, babe
Slowly, slowly lies you sold meAll saw the light of day

You been wasting time on the other side
If you′re satisfied, touché
Now you say you hate all the empty space
And if you could go back, you'd stay

Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It′s cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now

Chase me, chase me
That′s right, baby, yeah
Feel the way it feels
When you don't have control of who I′m holdin'
Is it feeding all your fears?

You been wasting time on the other side
If you′re satisfied, touché
But the lights are off, your so called friends are gone
Oh, I know what you're ′bout to say

Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now

Didn′t think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It′s cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now

I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna

Bet you miss me, bet you're reminiscing
I bet you hate the way that you said goodbye
And you still can′t even tell me why
I hate the way that you left me dry
But I'll keep that between you and I

I bet you didn′t think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me out of your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now (oh, touch me now)
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
