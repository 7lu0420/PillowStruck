Taylor-Swift_Blank-Space-Voice-Memo
So this next clip is, uh
From a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback
And what we like to doIs we like to run, um, a recording on our phones
Of everything we′re doing when we're putting a song together
Just in case one of us blurts out a
Cool melody and then we forget about it
We wanna go back and then
And replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves
What exactly we were saying
Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space"
And this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time, and
They′re shouting out these produc... production ideas like, you know
The "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus
Um, and that ended up in the song, so
This is the very beginning stages of a
Song on the album called "Blank Space"

Like
Nice to meet you
Where you been
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all these gems
It's the summer, and it's like
Oh my God, guess who knew
Lesson learned, I do too
Lesson learned, us who knew?

Boundless, endless, in his eyes
You can listen and listen good
All you think about this time others didn′t
Oh my God, this is me
I don′t care what you heard about me
Can't believe what you heard about me
Heard about me

′Cause
It's gonna be forever
Gonna go
(Yeah! Ey! Ey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it′s over
This is like a, this is like an early 2000's Nelly track now

Long list of ex-lovers
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They′ll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
I′ll write your name

Blank space, baby
I′ll write your name
It's so annoying, I love it
Oh my God, everyone′s gonna kill you
Yeah
