Chaney_Blank-Space
Tripping and falling over
Captured in blurry lights
I feel you coming closerWait for you in the night
Slowly
It′s all pitch blank, yet we go
And move slowly
Treading cautiously through the unknown

You know how to love me
Fill the blank space in my head
Been reaching out above me
Come fill the blank space in my bed

You know how to love me
Fill the blank space in my head
Been reaching out above me
Come fill the blank space in my bed

We're totally in the dark
And you save me, yeah
You know how to love me
Fill the blank space in my head

Blank space in my
Blank space in my
Blank space in my, blank space in my, blank space in my

Tripping and falling over
Captured in blurry lights
I feel you coming closer
Wait for you in the night
Slowly
It′s all pitch blank, yet we go
And move slowly
Treading cautiously through the unknown

Slowly
It's all pitch blank, yet we go
And move slowly
Treading cautiously through the unknown

You know how to love me
Fill the blank space in my head
Been reaching out above me
Come fill the blank space in my bed

You know how to love me
Fill the blank space in my head
Been reaching out above me
Come fill the blank space in my bed

We're totally in the dark
And you save me, yeah
You know how to love me
Fill the blank space in my head
