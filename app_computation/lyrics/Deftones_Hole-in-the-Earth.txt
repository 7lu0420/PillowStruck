Can you explain to me how
You′re so evil, how?
It's too late for me now
There′s a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth), I'm out
There's a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth), I′m out

Can you explain to me now?
If you′re still able, well
(It's time) I think you know the truth

There′s a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth), I'm out

I hate all of my friends
They all lack taste sometimes

There′s a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth), I'm out
There′s a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth)

Please take a bow (This is the end)
Somewhere (This is the end)

Somewhere

There's a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth)
There's a hole in the Earth (Hole in the Earth)
I hate all of my friends (I′m out)
There′s a hole in the earth (I will wait)
Somewhere
